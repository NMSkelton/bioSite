        <h2>Some of Mariel's hobbies</h2>
        <p class="hobby-text">The truth is, Mariel doesn’t have a ton of traditional “hobbies.” She has interests, sure—but they tend to come and go in waves, often tied to how much PTO she’s banked or whether a new video game has just dropped. If work counted as a hobby, it would easily take the top spot. But we’re not going there. Instead, let’s focus on the few things she genuinely enjoys.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">Fashion, while broad and hard to pin down as a hobby, is definitely one of Mariel’s stronger interests. She loves curating outfits, keeping up with the latest trends, and—most importantly—shopping for clothes. And then shopping for more clothes. What she doesn’t love? Laundry. That’s where the fashion fun ends.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">She’s also a fan of select video games, particularly ones with strong narratives and immersive worlds. Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us, and Grand Theft Auto are her top picks—especially when played on the easiest difficulty setting, with minimal combat. Story first, gunfights last.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">Lastly, travel has been growing into a bigger part of her (our) life. Mariel has set her sights on visiting every continent—yes, even Antarctica—and has already crossed off three. She thrives on planning trips in advance, researching every detail, and tracking down the best spots to eat and shop wherever we go.</p>
