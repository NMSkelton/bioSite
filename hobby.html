        <h2>Some of Mariel's hobbies</h2>
        <p class="hobby-text">The truth is, Mariel does not have many “hobby hobbies”. She has some interests, but they typically come in waves. And those waves usually correlate between how much PTO she has accrued, or perhaps a video game release she’s excited about. If work counted as a hobby, it would be #1 on the list. But I refuse to add that, and will focus on the couple of things she does enjoy.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">While fashion is a vague term, and a pretty difficult hobby to define, it is one of her bigger interests. She loves buying clothes, putting together outfits, buying clothes, staying up to date on current fashion trends, and buying clothes. She does not, however, enjoy doing laundry.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">Mariel does have a few video games she does enjoy, and a few that she has completed multiple times. Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us, and Grand Theft Auto are her favorites. She really enjoys story-driven adventure titles, typically on the easiest mode with the least amount of shooting possible.</p>
        <p class="hobby-text">And lastly, traveling is becoming a larger part of her (our) life. She has goals of visiting every continent at least once (that includes Antarctica), and has already knocked 3 off the list. Mariel loves planning and researching destinations beforehand, and usually finding the absolute best places to eat and shop.</p>
