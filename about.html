          <blockquote>"What do you need a quote for?" - Mariel, 2025</blockquote>
          <p class="about-text">Mariel was born (obviously) as one of three triplets—alongside her sister Malissa and brother Marcus—in sunny Tampa, Florida. She grew up like many 90s kids: playing with Bratz dolls, blasting Britney Spears on Tampa’s 93.3 FLZ, and logging countless hours on the original Pokémon games for Game Boy—while also building an impressive card collection. She played flag football, picked up the violin, and stuck with it through high school.</p>
          <p class="about-text">Her family eventually relocated to Ruskin, a smaller town just south of Tampa, where she attended Lennard High School. After graduation, Mariel moved to Fort Myers to attend Florida Gulf Coast University. There, she joined a sorority and—like all college students—dedicated herself exclusively to studying, never partying, and definitely never having any fun. Ever.</p>
          <p class="about-text">During her time at FGCU, she picked up a part-time job at the local outlet mall, where she happened to meet a pretty cool guy named Nick. But this isn’t his story. Mariel spent much of her free time lounging at the beach or making Target runs to Coconut Point with her best friend Ashley, until she graduated and landed a full-time job with Abercrombie & Fitch.</p>
          <p class="about-text">From there, she and that same cool guy made the move to the great state of Texas, where she now calls home.</p>
