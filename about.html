          <h1>How it all started</h1>
          <p class="about-text">Mariel was born one (obviously) of three triplets, along with her sister Malissa and brother Marcus, in the city of Tampa, Florida. She grew up like any other kid in the 90s - playing with Bratz dolls, listening to Britney Spears on Tampa’s 93.3 FLZ, and putting way too many hours into the original Pokemon games on the Gameboy, while also collecting the cards, of course. She loved playing flag football and eventually started playing the violin, the latter she would continue into high school. She attended Lennard High School in Ruskin, a smaller town just south of Tampa, after her family moved there as a child.</p>
          <p class="about-text">She remained in Ruskin until she moved off to college in Ft. Myers, Florida, to Florida Gulf Coast University. There, Mariel joined a sorority and did what most kids do in college: studied real hard and never went to a party or had any fun, ever. She eventually got a part time job at the local outlet mall where she met a really cool guy named Nick, but we’re not here to talk about him. Mariel spent a lot of her time hanging out at the beach and going to the Target in Coconut Point with her best friend Ashley, up until her graduation and eventual full job with Abercrombie and Fitch. From there, with that cool guy Nick from earlier, she moved to the great state of Texas where she currently resides.</p>
