          <h1>A bit about Mariel's past...</h1>
          <p class="top-text">A graduate of Florida Gulf Coast University’s Communications program, Mariel began her career with Abercrombie & Fitch as a Manager-in-Training. A clear standout among her peers, she quickly turned the entry-level role into a springboard for growth. Within a year, she was promoted to Assistant Manager and relocated to Houston’s Galleria Mall—one of the largest malls in the country.</p>
          <p class="top-text">Her success in Houston led to another promotion, this time to Store Manager, and a move to Austin, TX. Since then, Mariel has led and revitalized multiple stores across the Houston and Austin markets. She now serves as General Manager of one of the company’s largest locations and holds additional responsibility overseeing the entire Austin area’s stores.</p>

          <h1>...and a little about her future</h1>
          <p class="bot-text">Beyond her professional goals of becoming a District Manager—and perhaps eventually a Regional Manager—with Abercrombie, Mariel dreams of one day opening and running an animal sanctuary. She has a deep love for all furry creatures, especially those who are orphaned or injured. For her, no achievement rivals the joy of turning an animal’s life around and giving it the love and care she believes every one of them deserves.</p>
          <p class="bot-text">When the time comes to clock out for good, Mariel hopes to retire in her home state of Florida, with a summer home in the New York City area—living the true snowbird life. Between splitting time between city streets and white-sand beaches, she also hopes to see the world, with the ultimate goal of stepping foot on every continent.</p>
